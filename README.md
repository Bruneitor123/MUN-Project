#Info
This is a website I built as my first PHP project with HTML. It uses a public library to enhance the UI.

I personally built the PhP backend and all the database management. A demonstration of the website working is shown below using localhost:

The website address is pnu.aasoruro.com (It may not be active due to me graduating from my school)
